       " 58: ('  Customarily, in-plane auxeticity and synclastic bending behavior (i.e.\\nout-of-plane auxeticity) are not independent, being the latter a manifestation\\nof the former. Basically, this is a feature of three-dimensional bodies. At\\nvariance, two-dimensional bodies have more freedom to deform than\\nthree-dimensional ones. Here, we exploit this peculiarity and propose a\\ntwo-dimensional honeycomb structure with out-of-plane auxetic behavior opposite\\nto the in-plane one. With a suitable choice of the lattice constitutive\\nparameters, in its continuum description such a structure can achieve the whole\\nrange of values for the bending Poisson coefficient, while retaining a\\nmembranal Poisson coefficient equal to 1. In particular, this structure can\\nreach the extreme values, $-1$ and $+1$, of the bending Poisson coefficient.\\nAnalytical calculations are supported by numerical simulations, showing the\\naccuracy of the continuum formulas in predicting the response of the discrete\\nstructure.\\n',\n",

       " 59: ('  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the method of choice for\\nlearning problems involving 2D planar images. However, a number of problems of\\nrecent interest have created a demand for models that can analyze spherical\\nimages. Examples include omnidirectional vision for drones, robots, and\\nautonomous cars, molecular regression problems, and global weather and climate\\nmodelling. A naive application of convolutional networks to a planar projection\\nof the spherical signal is destined to fail, because the space-varying\\ndistortions introduced by such a projection will make translational weight\\nsharing ineffective.\\nIn this paper we introduce the building blocks for constructing spherical\\nCNNs. We propose a definition for the spherical cross-correlation that is both\\nexpressive and rotation-equivariant. The spherical correlation satisfies a\\ngeneralized Fourier theorem, which allows us to compute it efficiently using a\\ngeneralized (non-commutative) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. We\\ndemonstrate the computational efficiency, numerical accuracy, and effectiveness\\nof spherical CNNs applied to 3D model recognition and atomization energy\\nregression.\\n',\n",
